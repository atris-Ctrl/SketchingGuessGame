        Hey there, this is Atris ‚Äì great to have you drop by!

        You know, I was just chilling during my summer break, 
        and it hits me ‚Äì why not bring together my love for drawing 
        and my coding skills? After some digging, I saw google has a website called Quick Draw which is fascinating!
         And ta-da, this website was born! ‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏è
        
        It's all about taking my doodles and letting technology work its magic. 
        The result? Well, you're about to find out! I'm all ears for suggestions,
         questions, or just a friendly chat.üé®üëã

        Love,
        <br>
